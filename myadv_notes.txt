/* 
Goal is to have data on a map. Lines and stop-points on a map.

source data : the *.log files or data in a table (ora or pg)
output: a map to display in browser.

datamodel: 
    load-table: load the log files in tables, 
    route-table: order/parition by Date (and time), select-into
    for large volumes: convert by sqlldr into load-table, and exch-part

implement
 - create a GPRMC table (just this type is enough for the moment)
 - sqlldr to load, potentially also external file
 - use DT to select-order into data table, use seq to catch doubles.

table:  see ct_gprmc.sql

how to get lat + long: 
select
  round (   trunc ( g.lat / 100 ) 
         +  mod ( g.lat / 100, 1 ) * 100/60, 6  ) as lat_dec
, ' ,  ' as komma 
, round (   trunc ( g.lon / 100 ) 
         +  mod ( g.lon / 100, 1 ) * 100/60, 6 ) as lon_dec
